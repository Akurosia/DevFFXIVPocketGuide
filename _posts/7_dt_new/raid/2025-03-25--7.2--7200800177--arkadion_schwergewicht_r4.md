contentdescription: "You have climbed the ranks of the cruiserweight tier to reach the title match, and the stakes could not be higher. With that which gives your lives' purpose on the line, the match between the unenhanced warrior and the Howling Blade has all of Alexandria on the edge of their seats. It is time to see once and for all who will come out on top: the lone wolf, or the undefeated upstart? "
