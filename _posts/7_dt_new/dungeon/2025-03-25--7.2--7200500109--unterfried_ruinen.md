contentdescription: "In the waning days of the old kingdom, the people of Alexandria sought a way to survive as their home sank beneath the earth. They built a towering structure that enveloped the royal castle itself, and as the long years came and went, Everkeep grew to soaring heights. Yet some whisper that the castle has withstood the ravages of time, and in the city's foundation endures as a symbol of bygone glory. From within those timeworn depths Calyx sends his transmissions, and you must delve into Alexandria's past to ascertain their source."
