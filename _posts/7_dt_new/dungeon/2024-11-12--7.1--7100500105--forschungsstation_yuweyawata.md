contentdescription: "Before the dome appeared, in the northern region of what is now Heritage Found, a Tonawawtan village was terrorized by a tural vidraal. Zoraal Ja himself led the Landsguard in an effort to quell the beast's boundless fury, yet while the First Promise returned in triumph, few know what became of the village and its people. In your search for clues as to the identity of Gulool Ja's mother, you learn that Zoraal Ja visited the region many times over the years, and that it may be home to a secret research facility. And so you and yours attempt to retrace the King of Resolve's steps and unearth a buried past..."
