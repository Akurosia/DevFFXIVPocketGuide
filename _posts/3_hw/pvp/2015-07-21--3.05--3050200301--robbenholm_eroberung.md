contentdescription: "Legend has it that Llymlaen sealed a giant serpent She Herself created within Swallowtail Roam, an island said to drift about the sea so that those with evil intentions might never find it. When Seal Rock was first discovered, many believed it to be the selfsame island─but its true nature remained unknown until the Calamity laid her secrets bare. Upon their return to the island following the fall of Dalamud, Allied forces discovered Allagan tomeliths containing a wealth of knowledge. They concluded that the entire island was in fact an Allagan construct─a proving ground for Omega and other technology they developed to combat the primal threat. As was the case in Carteneau, control of the island and its resources remain disputed, and peaceful negotiations have failed to achieve a resolution. And so, once more, they would settle the matter on the battlefield."
