2TNKS = tethers - if RO, one tank goes to east, west, south, etc.
1HEAL = no debuff - stand with a shared sentence in north

JUDGEMENT CRYSTAL (Marker)
players are marked with red marker
drops crystal at their locations
these explode if close to alex with a proximity attack called tetrashatter
must place crystals appropriately (see images)

crystal -> incinerating heat -> crystal -> one of either sacrament -> crystal -> punishing heat -> crystal

INCEPTION (mechanic)
alex disappears and then reappears at one of the red dots on the edge of the platform.
use the crystals to act as a warning - the proximity indicator will tell you which crystal will explode, therefore where alex is going to come down

does either 2K or 10K
be at appropriate range to avoid damage

this time there are debuffs
MT = defamation - you go one way
1HEAL = shared sentence - you go the other way

HEAL + DPS = tether
DPS + DPS = tether

&

TETRASHATTER (proximity AOE)
does either 2K or 10K
be at appropriate range to avoid damage
