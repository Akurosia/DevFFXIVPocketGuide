Halicarnassus

Critical Hit
tankbuster - tankswap if you run out of CDs
very high damage

spellblade holy (holy edge & holy blur) & pole shift
3 holy edge markers
one stack holy blur Marker
2 HE players are tethered, while the remaining is tethered to the holy blur
2 tethered holy edge players move far away from the group
remaining holy edge player stays on boss while holy blur player moves away from group
pole shift swapes all marked players spots with their tether partner
the holy blur player should be moved onto the boss where the remaining unmarked players are already standing to soak the stack damage

the queens waltz (normal floor tiles)
high damage blades at all players
assign positions in a star around the boss to avoid overlapping damage
no telegraph

Haste - 6s haste Buff
typically followed by spellblade variation

Spellblade
spellblade thunder III
column aoe on single player - paralysis and vuln up

spellblade fire III
donut aoe with tight melee safe zone - fire and vuln up

spellblade blizzard III
point blank Circular
freeze and vuln up

dimensional wave
high raid wide AoE

the playing field & the game
normal version
6 role tiles and oink - don't get turned into a pig by stacking together and stand in your role tile



Phase 02

panel swap 01 - Briar & Flower tiles
briar tiles (thorns) are bad (slow and deal damage)

tile diagrams

the queen's waltz (briar tiles)
vine tethers on all players - run away from your tether to break them
if you don't break them fast enough - debuffs or death
tanks and healers will be tethered to DPS - DPS run in one direction, while the tanks and healers run in the Other

spellblade fire III

haste

spellblade thunder III

critical hit

dimensional wave

place token
white flame add
separate the add from the boss as soon as possible
add does pretty heavy damage
casts large point blank aoe that will heal the main boss if she's standing in it

haste

spellblade blizzard III

mindjack
assigns all players a timed buff that will eventually force them to run in the direction of the buff icon - this will be cast alongside the queen's waltz - line your buff icon up with the direction you have to run to break your tether so that you're forced in the proper corner

the queens waltz (briar tiles)

spellblade fire III

dimensional wave



Phase 03

panel swap 02 - cave tiles
blue tiles are safe, black are dangerous

place token
great dragon add
frost breath cleave - OT should face the add away from the group

the queens waltz (cave tiles)
raid wide aoe + black tiles explode
stand on blue tiles to avoid

ribbit
huge frontal cone on random player
turns players into frogs - move behind boss to avoid

dimensional wave

critical hit

place dark token
soul reaper adds that rush across the platform in columns
soul reaper add in the middle with point blank circle
paired with the queen's waltz - renders only 1 blue tile safe from everything - find this tile quickly and sprint there

haste

random spellblade

dimensional wave




Phase 04

panel swap 03
