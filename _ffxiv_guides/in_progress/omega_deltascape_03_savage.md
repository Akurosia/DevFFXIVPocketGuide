Halicarnassus

Critical Hit
tankbuster - tankswap if you run out of CDs
very high damage

spellblade holy (holy edge & holy blur) & pole shift
3 holy edge markers
one stack holy blur Marker
2 HE players are tethered, while the remaining is tethered to the holy blur
2 tethered holy edge players move far away from the group
remaining holy edge player stays on boss while holy blur player moves away from group
pole shift swapes all marked players spots with their tether partner
the holy blur player should be moved onto the boss where the remaining unmarked players are already standing to soak the stack damage

the queens waltz (normal floor tiles)
high damage blades at all players
assign positions in a star around the boss to avoid overlapping damage
no telegraph

Haste - 6s haste Buff
typically followed by spellblade variation

Spellblade
spellblade thunder III
column aoe on single player - paralysis and vuln up

spellblade fire III
donut aoe with tight melee safe zone - fire and vuln up

spellblade blizzard III
point blank Circular
freeze and vuln up

dimensional wave
high raid wide AoE

the playing field & the game
normal version
6 role tiles and oink - don't get turned into a pig by stacking together and stand in your role tile



Phase 02

panel swap 01 - Briar & Flower tiles
briar tiles (thorns) are bad (slow and deal damage)

tile diagrams

the queen's waltz (briar tiles)
vine tethers on all players - run away from your tether to break them
if you don't break them fast enough - debuffs or death
tanks and healers will be tethered to DPS - DPS run in one direction, while the tanks and healers run in the Other

spellblade fire III

haste

spellblade thunder III

critical hit

dimensional wave

place token
white flame add
separate the add from the boss as soon as possible
add does pretty heavy damage
casts large point blank aoe that will heal the main boss if she's standing in it

haste

spellblade blizzard III

mindjack
assigns all players a timed buff that will eventually force them to run in the direction of the buff icon - this will be cast alongside the queen's waltz - line your buff icon up with the direction you have to run to break your tether so that you're forced in the proper corner

the queens waltz (briar tiles)

spellblade fire III

dimensional wave



Phase 03

panel swap 02 - cave tiles
blue tiles are safe, black are dangerous

place token
great dragon add
frost breath cleave - OT should face the add away from the group

the queens waltz (cave tiles)
raid wide aoe + black tiles explode
stand on blue tiles to avoid

ribbit
huge frontal cone on random player
turns players into frogs - move behind boss to avoid

dimensional wave

critical hit

place dark token
soul reaper adds that rush across the platform in columns
soul reaper add in the middle with point blank circle
paired with the queen's waltz - renders only 1 blue tile safe from everything - find this tile quickly and sprint there

haste

random spellblade

dimensional wave




Phase 04

panel swap 03 - library phase

8 "book tiles" that can be consumed by players if you stand in them. These provide specific vulnerability down debuffs and will be required during the phase to avoid mechanics - DONT STAND IN THEM UNTIL NECESSARY

the queens waltz (library tiles)
drops folio books down on all players - each book is the size of one tile - each player needs to be in a unique tile of the 8 blank tiles. high damage - healers will have to heal through this

oink

place token
apanda add
OT should pick this up and everyone should burn it down asap
add casts magic hammer - massive circular aoes under ALL players - bait them together

the queen's waltz
this happens at the same time as magic hammer - diagram

squelch
gaze that turns players into a imp

dimensional wave

critical hit

dimensional wave

Spellblade holy
2 holy blurs
4 holy edges
2 unmarked
not enough players to handle everything - use the books.
holy blur and unmarked players grab blue books
holy edge players grab green books
books provide magic/phys up but also stop actions for 8 seconds
queens waltz is happening at the same time
- green players hang out in their unique waltz tiles
- blue and unmarker players have to stand in their own unique waltz tiles BUT have to be close enough together to be considered stacked
BEWARE - healers will be out of actions for some time after the attacks go off - be careful

dimensional wave



Phase 05

Panel Swap 04 - All tiles - diagram

fight boss in center at all times so that you have the most advanced notice for queens waltz

the playing field - 2 frogs, 2 imps, 2 pigs
Ribbit - Oink - Squelch in random order
1 player in each tile or wipe
healers get hit first, tanks second, DPS third to maximize damage
The game
If executed properly, you get instant LB3!

the queen's waltz - type depends on which tile she's standing on

spellblade holy & pole shift

critical hit

mindjack & place dark token
GRDFSHGFHSGHDGHDGH

Queen's Waltz
