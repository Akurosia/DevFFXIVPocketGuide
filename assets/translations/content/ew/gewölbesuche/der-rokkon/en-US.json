    "Instancecontenttextdata_36375_Text": "Were I a treasure─cursed or no─I imagine I would abide within these walls. But where...",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36376_Text": "Under the auspices of two auspices, as it were. Curious.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36377_Text": "So the glass serves as a magicked doorknob of sorts? The monks were certainly inventive...",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36378_Text": "You too are a connoisseur of Far Eastern maps, I trust? Terribly charming, how the Four Lords are shown ruling the cardinal directions.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36380_Text": "I might have known that Suzaku and Seiryu were the guardians of this gateway─though in fairness, one usually needs grapple with only one at a time. ",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36381_Text": "...Would that we had arrived sooner. Judging by her supernatural size, the demons have already taken that poor shinobi.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36382_Text": "She must be in the thrall of a treasure. A promising lead...though at an unfortunate cost.",

    "Instancecontenttextdata_36402_Text": "A clash for the ages! Life-threatening circumstances aside, 'tis always a pleasure to witness bushido at work.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36408_Text": "How pleasingly picturesque! Had we no demons to slay, I would suggest a more leisurely stroll.",

    "Instancecontenttextdata_36415_Text": "The statues keep silent vigil in their masters' absence...but they are not the treasures we seek. Onward!",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36416_Text": "The temple stretches on ever further. Step lively, ! We've plenty to explore.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36417_Text": "Even the inner sanctum is plagued with demons. If any who remained did survive, 'twould be nothing short of a miracle.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36418_Text": "Splendid as these statues are, they appear lacking in the “accursed” aspect. Our quarry must lie further in.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36419_Text": "Though the temple's isolation is a blessing for the smallfolk, I imagine it made the monks' experience all the more harrowing...",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36420_Text": "We have yet to see hide nor hair of Gorai...",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36421_Text": "Breathtaking! 'Tis as though the majestic tiger it depicts might pounce off the screen at any─ Oh?",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36422_Text": "That was not an invitation! Your assistance, please, !",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36423_Text": "That precarious pile of crates is a mountain unto itself! ",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36424_Text": "Somehow, I doubt that brute has learned its lesson... But let us continue on.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36425_Text": "By the kami, , how did you get up there?",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36426_Text": "Adventurers and their climbing... Why, just the other day, on Kugane Tower─ But perhaps that is a tale for another time.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36427_Text": "That sounded promising... If you suddenly hear my winsome wailing, you had best come running!",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36428_Text": "Ah, a secret stairwell! How very convenient.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36429_Text": "Both master and minion, irascible to the last...",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36435_Text": "And so the demon is slain!",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36436_Text": "Though his avarice availed him curious tools, your skill carried the day.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36437_Text": "One wonders what artifacts he might have unveiled had you waited a touch longer to deal the killing blow...but there's naught to be done about it now. ",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36441_Text": "Admirable as always, ! Few would be so keen to face down a rat of that size.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36447_Text": "Curious... This lantern shines differently than the rest. The mononoke's influence, perhaps?",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36448_Text": "No, some other mechanism. What if I...",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36449_Text": "Lesson learned, Hancock─do not prod eerily glowing objects!",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36450_Text": "In any case, the monks went to great pains to conceal this path. What could have warranted such secrecy?",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36451_Text": "Kami forfend! We could suffocate under this wicked haze...",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36452_Text": "I'd wager the tsukumogami is the pipe itself─its body a mere illusion.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36453_Text": "A brilliant display! With the demonic smoke dispelled, we may breathe easy once more.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36454_Text": "Only an entity of great power could transform its surrounds so dramatically. You did well to outmaneuver it.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36461_Text": "Shrink before my might! Quiver in awe!",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36462_Text": "A path straight up the holy mount, is it? How refreshingly dangerous!",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36464_Text": "The Hingans call these clay figures “dogu”─but why is one here, of all places?",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36465_Text": "Best to let sleeping dogu lie. For all we know, it could be cursed.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36466_Text": "If that dogu turns on us, its extermination shall be your responsibility, I hope you know!",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36467_Text": "Fallen leaves and fresh greenery in such close proximity? 'Tis passing strange.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36468_Text": "There are few things more breathtaking than autumnal leaves...even if they are out of season. The influence of a treasure, I suspect.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36469_Text": "I understand you adventurers enjoy the roads less traveled, but─ And there she goes. Courage, Hancock!",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36470_Text": "Such a tranquil place, these mountain heights. By the look of it, I presume it is not a path that many tread.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36471_Text": "Hmm... 'Tis not the first of those stones we've encountered. Do they serve as shrines of some sort?",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36472_Text": "No shrine is built without purpose...or so I have heard. If such is the case, then what might this one be for?",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36474_Text": "I, for one, have naught but respect for our new clay comrade! ...Do you think it can hear us?",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36475_Text": "The warding talismans on this boulder give me pause...but it shall serve as well as any bridge, I suppose.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36476_Text": "One cannot go wrong with a rustic log bridge─assuming the trunk is free of angry spirits, of course...",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36477_Text": "Gods be good! I know not how, but the statue has awakened...and it did not wake on the right side of the proverbial bed!",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36478_Text": "Just a moment─I have read of this before! If I am not mistaken, that mononoke is Shishio, king among nue!",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36479_Text": "Even a king of beasts is no match for you, I see! Well done, .",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36485_Text": "A deed fit for legend! Quite literally, for Shishio appears in countless Hingan myths.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36486_Text": "One, in fact, tells of a wayfaring warrior who triumphed over it long ago.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36491_Text": "That is one mononoke felled─though if the legends are to be believed, Shishio is a wholly different beast than its tsukumogami brethren.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36492_Text": "It came to the mountain long before Gorai's time─was sealed here by the very founder of Shojo Temple, in fact.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36497_Text": "A harrowing display! Such ferocity have I rarely seen!",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36503_Text": "The chorus of steel rings eternal!",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36504_Text": "Mark where the armor readies its blade─though it has quite a reach, it cannot strike everywhere at once!",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_36506_Text": "A sorry attempt at an ambush, if you ask me...but let us continue on.",
    "Npcyell_2671_Text": "There is no escape!",
    "Npcyell_4859_Text": "The abyss comes!",
    "Npcyell_15703_Text": "Were I to chart our course...",
