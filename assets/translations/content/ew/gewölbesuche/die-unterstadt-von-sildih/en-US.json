    "Instancecontenttextdata_34017_Text": "Nald preserve me from creepers and crawlers. Pray clear the path, <Split([ObjectParameter(1)], ,1)/>.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34018_Text": "What do they feed on down here? Each other? And why must it smell so positively putrid?",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34020_Text": "Even empty of pests, this place is a dank, mold-ridden nightmare. How long has it lain untended?",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34021_Text": "Ugh! Pfbt! Pfbt! Thome of id fell in by bouth... Is adventuring always this disgusting!?",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34022_Text": "I should rather not traverse a fungal bridge, but I suppose if we hurry across...",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34023_Text": "The decay is especially bad in this section. I fear the fungal growth is all which keeps it from collapsing.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34024_Text": "Gah! You see!? Even the water is some ghastly shade of...wait. Is that ceruleum?",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34025_Text": "If you can best a hecatoncheir so handily, then it certainly bodes well for the remainder of our expedition!",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34026_Text": "To think that such a cavernous hollow yawns directly beneath Ul'dah!",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34027_Text": "Raising one of these lifts should provide us passage across. Assuming, of course, that the winch yet functions...",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34028_Text": "Interesting. The lift appears of Ul'dahn design, albeit an old one, but everything else screams “Amalj'aa.”",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34029_Text": "Yes, most definitely Amalj'aa construction. Fortifications built for war, rather than habitation, I would say.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34030_Text": "Could this camp be from the time of the zombie purge? Was Father hoping I would see this one day...?",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34031_Text": "Did you know that Ul'dahn and Amalj'aa once fought side by side? 'Tis not common knowledge.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34032_Text": "A door of solid iron─and no sign my key will open it. Do you see any handy levers or the like...?",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34034_Text": "Who is speaking!? Well, I've not come this far to let a door turn me away. Break it down!",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34035_Text": "Impressive! 'Tis akin to having my own personal battering ram!",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34036_Text": "Disembodied voices, dimly lit staircases... It has the feel of a haunted crypt.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34038_Text": "A tragic end to a valiant warrior. He at least seemed unaware of his...affliction.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34039_Text": "Still, I must wonder how long this fallen hero slumbered here in cursed undeath. Trapped alone in this forgotten tomb...",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34040_Text": "Though we worship different gods, I shall offer up a prayer for his peaceful repose all the same.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34042_Text": "We've uncovered much and more─plenty enough to occupy my thoughts for the time being. You have my thanks!",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34043_Text": "Impressive! A lifetime of adventure teaches one more than just battlecraft, I see.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34044_Text": "'Tis so stately and subdued in here... I am reminded of Erralig's Burial Chamber.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34046_Text": "A tragic end to a valiant warrior. He at least seemed unaware of his...affliction.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34047_Text": "And yet so abhorrent was the zombie curse, even a hero of his obvious stature was sealed behind an iron door.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34048_Text": "If only that powder had never been concocted... Heavy do I feel the burden of my ancestors' sins this day.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34050_Text": "We've uncovered much and more─plenty enough to occupy my thoughts for the time being. You have my thanks!",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34051_Text": "Nay, this rot cannot be allowed to continue. The tunnels need reinforcement, not to mention a thorough cleaning...",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34055_Text": "Interesting. The lift appears of Ul'dahn design, albeit an old one, but everything else screams “Amalj'aa.”",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34056_Text": "Yes, most definitely Amalj'aa construction. Fortifications built for war, rather than habitation, I would say.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34057_Text": "Drakes! Just like the ones the Amalj'aa tame! Is it me, or are some of these creatures awfully large...?",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34058_Text": "You've triggered some spell of opening! I wonder why they chose to conceal this passage...",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34059_Text": "Oh, I see! This must be where they stored their ritual materials.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34060_Text": "These are precious relics, every one. Think you they might be blessed or enchanted in some fashion?",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34061_Text": "'Tis so stately and subdued in here... I am reminded of Erralig's Burial Chamber.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34063_Text": "A tragic end to a valiant warrior. He at least seemed unaware of his...affliction.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34064_Text": "What cruel irony that a hero of the zombie purge would become the very thing he sought to vanquish.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34068_Text": "We've uncovered much and more─plenty enough to occupy my thoughts for the time being. You have my thanks!",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34070_Text": "And in mere moments, the way is clear! Hardly an inconvenience for our mighty champion.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34071_Text": "Surely you do not expect me to cross that rickety thing! Slowly, then...and no rocking the bridge!",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34072_Text": "I specifically requested no rocking, bouncing, or jouncing! Gods above, I was almost pitched over the side...",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34073_Text": "That gate looks awfully heavy. Let us try the handle, and hope these gears and chains do most of the lifting.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34074_Text": "Oh, it opened! I worried it may have rusted shut.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34075_Text": "The size of your opponent matters not, it seems! A reassuring thought as we delve further into the unknown!",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34076_Text": "I am put in mind of mine own chambers, secret passageways and all. I wonder...",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34077_Text": "Of course, this is the Sil'dihn royal palace! Look at this banner by the door here...",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34079_Text": "Ah...I've seen such contrivances before. We must balance the scales ere we can proceed.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34080_Text": "Simply a matter of selecting the correct weights! Surely you recognize one or two of these symbols, yes?",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34082_Text": "That gap is rather wide... Barring some unlikely acrobatics on my part, I am afraid we are at an impasse.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34083_Text": "Oh, but what of these levers? Their position seems highly suggestive of their relation to yon yawning pit.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34084_Text": "Heavens forfend... Am I to trust in this wind to carry me over!?",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34085_Text": "How undignified! I shall be seeking out an alternate route for the return trip!",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34087_Text": "I would not have believed anyone could topple that silver-skinned brute had I not seen it with mine own eyes!",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34088_Text": "Thinking on it now, all these defenses were likely put in place to ensure an escape route for the royal family.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34093_Text": "Gracious! Would they haul the boulder up the ramp every time...? Still, I must say it makes for a stable bridge!",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34095_Text": "I would not have believed anyone could topple that silver-skinned brute had I not seen it with mine own eyes!",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34096_Text": "Judging by the sentinels we've encountered, 'tis clear Sil'dih's military was a force to be reckoned with.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34101_Text": "Oh, it opened! I worried it may have rusted shut.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34102_Text": "The size of your opponent matters not, it seems! A reassuring thought as we delve further into the unknown!",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34103_Text": "We've wandered into some antique dining hall. A rich setting, indeed; one might even say “palatial.”",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34104_Text": "Of course, this is the Sil'dihn royal palace! Look at this banner by the door here...",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34105_Text": "Aha! That lit up the teleporter! Come along─nothing ventured, nothing gained.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34106_Text": "The royal treasury! A puzzle solved leading to riches untold... Just like in the stories!",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34107_Text": "But look at these scattered coins... Has a burglar broken in before us, perchance?",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34109_Text": "The door is open, but not so the way. Mayhap salvation lies with Nald or Thal...?",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34110_Text": "The barrier fades! 'Twould seem your prayers were answered.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34112_Text": "I would not have believed anyone could topple that silver-skinned brute had I not seen it with mine own eyes!",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34113_Text": "A dreadful sentry and a dead end chamber... I suspect this was a trap for overly ambitious thieves.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34118_Text": "Oho! 'Twould seem your prayers were answered.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34120_Text": "I would not have believed anyone could topple that silver-skinned brute had I not seen it with mine own eyes!",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34121_Text": "There are no other exits that I can spy... I suspect this chamber was a dead end for cornering thieves.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34127_Text": "A storage room for ceremonial objects suggests a ceremonial chamber is nearby...",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34128_Text": "Ah... An Amalj'aa coffin, if I am not mistaken.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34130_Text": "You are performing the funerary rites? Then I should light the incense, and say a prayer for the fallen.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34131_Text": "Another secret passage!? This place certainly is full of surprises.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34134_Text": "Ul'dahn and Amalj'aa banners, hanging side by side... What have we stumbled into this time?",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34135_Text": "This book appears to be a catalog of some kind. Oh! These items are all proof of the past alliance!",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34136_Text": "And what is this wedged in its pages...? “May the reader of this letter be our darling Nanamo.”",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34137_Text": "If this message is for me, then why leave it here!? My parents had such faith that I would find it...",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34138_Text": "Nay...'tis the vault itself they wished for me to discover. And these priceless truths preserved within.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34139_Text": "Come, let us return to Ul'dah, where I can thank you properly for your most invaluable escort!",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34141_Text": "Three more gates...? 'Twould seem we have a choice to make.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34143_Text": "Oh, we've picked the same gate! That settles that, then!",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34144_Text": "Hm, why that one...? Very well. The adventurer knows best!",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34146_Text": "These creatures look distinctly unfriendly. If you would be so kind...?",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34147_Text": "Barely a test of your mettle, I see. Well done!",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34148_Text": "Some manner of rodent? Surely even I can best a couple of mice...",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34149_Text": "Gah! Not mice, not mice, definitely not mice!",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34150_Text": "Strange to think these giant pipes lie unseen, just yalms beneath the streets of Ul'dah...",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34151_Text": "That culvert at the back is positively clogged. Would more water flush out the mud, I wonder?",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34152_Text": "Oh, that redirected the water flow! 'Tis the first I've seen such a mechanism at work!",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34153_Text": "Where do you suppose that water went to...?",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34155_Text": "These waterways are in dire need of maintenance. I must arrange something with the palace custodians.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34158_Text": "Strange. Its aether feels awfully, well, familiar, if you would pardon the pun.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34159_Text": "You see that bubble around its puff? That must be how it channels its cleaning magicks!",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34161_Text": "That grape-embossed helm... 'Tis the mark of a Sil'dihn-forged gladiator!",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34162_Text": "Haaargh... Haaaaaargh!",

    "Instancecontenttextdata_34170_Text": "A hecatoncheir!? Why would it make its lair in this muddy pit?",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34171_Text": "Why would a hecatoncheir be down here!? It seems disinclined to let us pass peacefully...",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34172_Text": "What is that noise? Something coming down the drainage pipes?",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34173_Text": "Ugh, the reek of sewage is overpowering! Does this hecatoncheir have no sense of smell!?",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34174_Text": "That bluish film atop the water is ceruleum! But that hardly explains the hecatoncheir in the room...",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34175_Text": "Watch your footing! 'Tis coming up through the floor!",

    "Instancecontenttextdata_34177_Text": "Is that a hecatoncheir!? And those rollers... Some form of conveyance?",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34179_Text": "Is he playing games...? Mind the barrel tops─there must be a reason for those markings.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34204_Text": "And victory is yours! I am blessed to keep company with such a formidable ally.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34207_Text": "Ah, that breeze feels wonderful after the stuffy closeness of the tunnels.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34208_Text": "Bother. My key was not made to open this gate. ...Hm? It says here, “Two eyes are needed to see.”",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34209_Text": "Two eyes... Some manner of riddle, do you suppose?",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34210_Text": "Oh! This was no simple pattern on the floor! It was a teleportation portal!",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34211_Text": "Let's see where it leads, shall we?",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34212_Text": "Golems! And blocking the path we mean to take, no less.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34213_Text": "Who would have abandoned their cleaning gear in here?",

    "Instancecontenttextdata_34217_Text": "'Tis said that it could scoop up any amount of water at once, and was locked away after it drained an entire oasis.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34219_Text": "That final burst of aether confirmed my suspicions: 'twas definitely Mother who created the silkie.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34220_Text": "What have we here...?",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34221_Text": "Such a beautiful garden! Not the sort of place one expects to find at the end of a grimy tunnel.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34222_Text": "And this tableware...",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34223_Text": "These things belonged to Mother and Father!",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34224_Text": "This must have been their quiet little retreat; the familiar put in place to protect it.",

    "Instancecontenttextdata_34226_Text": "<sigh> Whilst I should like to linger still, I fear Papashan will soon note my absence. Let us be away.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34227_Text": "This rug, too, seems a relatively recent addition. See how the stone beneath it is cracked and worn?",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34228_Text": "'Tis doubtful some thief had a sudden fit of decorating...but we shall leave it for now. Other mysteries abound.",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34229_Text": "Talk of jugs behind barred doors reminded me of the legend, is all. Shall we continue on?",
    "Instancecontenttextdata_34231_Text": "The silkie's aether... It had the exact same feel as Mother's.",

    "Instancecontenttextdata_34249_Text": "They told me of a private place to which they would slip away; a haven from the bustle of palace life.",
