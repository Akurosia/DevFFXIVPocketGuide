Worshipped by a Meracydian race of centaur-like beings, this eikon manifested upon the physical plane as an embodiment of eternal victory. And yet, despite his godlike might, Zurvan was captured. He has languished in his Allagan-made prison now for five thousand years, his primal desire for justice swelling in magnitude with each passing millennium...<br/><br/><br/><br/>Through an unlikely alliance with the VIth Imperial Legion, you and your companions were able to prevent a catastrophic awakening orchestrated by the Demon's thralls. But your work is not yet finished. Honor the sacrifice of Regula van Hydrus, and remove the threat of Zurvan from this world once and for all!",
