    "Npcyell_11423_Text": "The mascots will take turns striking their favorite poses, and we ask that you show your celebratory spirit by posing in kind.",
    "Npcyell_11425_Text": "Here is a pose that maximizes your muscular appeal.",
    "Npcyell_11426_Text": "Do the mighty maximizer, and show the fine specimen that you are, kupo!",
    "Npcyell_11428_Text": "Before using the aetheromatic clipper, it is important to point and acknowledge.",
