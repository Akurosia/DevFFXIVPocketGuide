Long ago in its shadow, a bloody battle was waged between Yok Huy tribes, and ages on from that struggle, the Grand Companies of Eorzea have secured access to this ancient battlefield that they might put their forces to the proof. Join the fray now beneath your chosen banner, and under the watchful gaze of the snow spirits, fight your way to victory and glory!",
