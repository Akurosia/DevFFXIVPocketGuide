    "npcyell_ids_11870_Text": "I tire of this contest! If you seek my best, then you shall have it!",
    "npcyell_ids_11871_Text": "And I will weather the storm just as you taught me...with heart and steel!",

    "npcyell_ids_11875_Text": "My aether... How feeble grows its fire...",
    "npcyell_ids_11876_Text": "Quickly, bind him while he is still weak!",
    "npcyell_ids_11877_Text": "<pant> <pant> <pant> It is done, Master Lovro. The healing can begin!",
    "npcyell_ids_11900_Text": "You appear to be Bozjan, sir, but how came you to this place?",
    "npcyell_ids_11901_Text": "...Dabog? It is you, is it not? There were reports of your capture two years ago!",
    "npcyell_ids_11902_Text": "This is hyperpilot Dabog. Hostile forces confirmed. Initiating combat.",
    "npcyell_ids_11904_Text": "I recognize that warmachina! ...And now we know who the pilot was.",
    "npcyell_ids_11905_Text": "Dabog is not in his right mind, but he leaves us little choice. Defend yourselves!",
    "npcyell_ids_11906_Text": "Fight their control, Dabog! This is not who you are!",
    "npcyell_ids_11907_Text": "Energy levels dropping. Initiating subroutines. Launching alternative attack patterns.",
    "npcyell_ids_11910_Text": "This is hyperpilot Dabog. Hull integrity compromised. Retreating to base.",
    "npcyell_ids_11911_Text": "Dabog, wait! Let us help you!",
    "npcyell_ids_11912_Text": "Is tempering not abhorrent enough!? Must they seek out new ways to twist and control men's hearts!?",
    "npcyell_ids_11914_Text": "Then we must work doubly hard not to lose our own. We stay the course, and hope it also leads to his salvation...",
    "npcyell_ids_11925_Text": "So you are one of Gunnhildr's Blades, yes? Thank you for kindly volunteering this information.",
    "npcyell_ids_11930_Text": "Curses, there are too many...",
    "npcyell_ids_11931_Text": "Allow us to even the odds!",
    "npcyell_ids_11938_Text": "Thank you, my friends! Let us put an end to the Empire's villainy!",
    "npcyell_ids_11971_Text": "If none of them are Dabog, what have you done with him!?",
    "npcyell_ids_11972_Text": "Ah yes, subject VIII. He was a truly exceptional prototype.",
    "npcyell_ids_11973_Text": "Alas, his flesh eventually succumbed to the rigors of testing. Controlling such complex machinery takes a heavy toll, you see.",
    "npcyell_ids_11974_Text": "Fortunately, we were able to overcome this problem by means of the VIIth's data extraction technique.",
    "npcyell_ids_11975_Text": "From his combat expertise to his memories, we transferred everything into these enhanced soldiers. ",
    "npcyell_ids_11976_Text": "What!? You heartless fiend! Does your depravity know no bounds!?",
    "npcyell_ids_11977_Text": "You will pay for this! We will avenge Dabog!",
    "npcyell_ids_11978_Text": "Impossible... That my enhanced unit should be wiped out...",
    "npcyell_ids_11979_Text": "So be it. I had intended to conduct more tests, but you leave me no choice. Savor your victory while you still can!",
    "npcyell_ids_11982_Text": "Indeed. We will fight, and we will triumph─for Dabog and everyone we have lost.",
    "npcyell_ids_11983_Text": "Come, my friends. Let us return to the encampment and prepare for the next battle.",
    "npcyell_ids_12008_Text": "You are...much changed. What have those fiends done to you!?",
    "npcyell_ids_12035_Text": "Hull integrity at 60%. Firepower insufficient. Requesting helldiver reinforcements.",
    "npcyell_ids_12105_Text": "<trumpet>",

    "npcyell_ids_12109_Text": "You look...familiar.",
    "npcyell_ids_12110_Text": "Did I not hire you to provide enrichment for my newest acquisition?",
    "npcyell_ids_12111_Text": "He does so love to stomp, you see. There's nothing he enjoys more than the sound of shattering bone...",
    "npcyell_ids_12113_Text": "Save your grisly threats─our courage will not be so easily shaken. Form up! We take this oversized beast down!",
    "npcyell_ids_12114_Text": "You've had your fun, Lyuba! No more playing now!",
    "npcyell_ids_12115_Text": "<trumpet>",
    "npcyell_ids_12116_Text": "Lyuba! Nooo!",
    "npcyell_ids_12117_Text": "Why...? Why am I here...down in the dirt?",
    "npcyell_ids_12118_Text": "I will see you all ground into meat slop!",
    "npcyell_ids_12119_Text": "Your minced remains will fill the feeding troughs of my menagerie!",
    "npcyell_ids_12120_Text": "Do not give chase! You only risk being ambushed. See to the wounded, and keep watch for approaching enemies.",
    "npcyell_ids_12121_Text": "I must say, this Clarricie is proving to be a problem. Where does she keep finding all these fantastic beasts?",
    "npcyell_ids_12131_Text": "He's calling in fire support, but this is no time to withdraw! We stand our ground!",
    "npcyell_ids_12162_Text": "Please, Dabog! Come to your senses! We are not your enemy!",
    "npcyell_ids_12164_Text": "Tactical shift initiated. Resuming assault.",
    "npcyell_ids_12167_Text": "This is hyperpilot Dabog. Energy levels below minimum. Combat capabilities severely compromised. Returning to base.",
    "npcyell_ids_12168_Text": "Dabog!",
    "npcyell_ids_12170_Text": "Yet again we have failed our friend, and he remains at the enemy's mercy...",
    "npcyell_ids_12171_Text": "There is nothing left to be done here. Let us return to the encampment.",
    "npcyell_ids_12173_Text": "No... Defeat is an insult to my queen! I will hold back nothing. NOTHING!",
    "npcyell_ids_5_Text": "There are too many of them!",
    "npcyell_ids_62_Text": "There are too many of them!"
